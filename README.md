- 👋 Hi, I’m @C1ph3rPhr3ak
- 👀 I’m interested in helping the general public keep themselves safe from scammers on social media, as well as protecting their own home networks from malicious hackers.  I have many projects that i am currently working on, including, but not limited to, a dedicated antivirus software for Linux systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python script and Ducky script, and have even developed my own type of USB Rubber Ducky that acts as an automated login device for multiple websites, systems, and accounts, though it is not fully perfected just yet.  So far, so good, however.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects, and am definitely looking for some insight on a few of my upcoming projects, and will even offer my own insight on your projects as well.
- 📫 You can contact me at C1ph3rPhr3ak@proton.me if you have any questions or ideas.
- 😄 Pronouns: Look, I am a BIOLOGICAL MALE.  I am a MALE.  I shouldnt really have to say more, but he/his/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Licking doorknobs on an alien planet is illegal, but only if there is a posted sign.
